  "Sleep duration Text": "The duration of sleep is influenced by many factors such as genetics, subjective will, and circadian rhythm, making it difficult to establish an absolute standard. The National Sleep Foundation in the United States recommends that adults get 7 to 9 hours of sleep per day. Considering individual differences, a range of 6 to 10 hours is generally considered reasonable.",
  "Sleep structure Text 1": "Sleep is a complex physiological and behavioral process, typically divided into NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep based on the brainwave patterns, eye movement, and muscle tone changes during sleep; NREM sleep can further be divided into light sleep and deep sleep.",
  "Sleep structure Text 2": "Usually, a complete sleep cycle, consisting of wakefulness, light sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep occurring in sequence, is about 90-120 minutes long; approximately 4-6 of these sleep cycles occur in a night, interconnected and recurring.",
  "Sleep structure Text 3": "It is important to note that the above artificial divisions are made for research convenience; in reality, distinct boundaries between different sleep stages are hard to delineate, often gradually transitioning, overlapping, and emphasizing different aspects.",
  "Light sleep Text 1": "Typically, adults, after transitioning from wakefulness to sleep, first enter the stage of light sleep. During light sleep, the heartbeat and breathing slow down, muscles relax further, body temperature decreases, eye movements cease, brainwave activity slows down, and individuals are relatively easy to awaken.",
  "Light sleep Text 2": "Reference Range: 20% - 60% of the total sleep duration.",
  "Deep sleep Text 1": "During the stage of deep sleep, a person's heartbeat and breathing reach their lowest levels, there is no eye movement or muscle activity, and they are not easily awakened. If awakened, one may feel groggy. Experts believe that this stage is crucial for physical recovery, growth, and strengthening the immune system.",
  "Deep sleep Text 2": "Reference Range: 20% - 40% of the total sleep duration.",
  "Rapid eye movement-REM Text 1": "During Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep, muscle tension disappears, various physiological indicators are active but unstable, muscles that control daily activities are temporarily paralyzed, heart rate and breathing accelerate, and temperature regulation is mostly lost. It is difficult to wake up from this stage, and people who wake up from this stage can recall vivid and clear dreams.",

If one stays up late or experiences sleep interruptions, a nap the following day can help compensate for insufficient sleep.",

  "Heart Rate Description": "Heart Rate Description",
  "Heart Rate Text 1": "Each of us has our own resting heart rate and maximum heart rate. If you want to fully utilize exercise and fitness trackers, it is important to use a heart rate monitor to track your heart rate and understand the situation of each heart rate zone. Record heart rate before waking up in the morning. Do this every day for a week. This is your personal resting heart rate. During rest, the heart rate range of most people is usually between 60-100bpm. Regular exercise can improve blood supply to the heart, so your resting heart rate may decrease. It is normal for the heart rate to slow down to a range below normal resting heart rate during sleep. 40 to 50 beats per minute (bpm) is considered the average sleep heart rate for adults.",
  "Heart Rate Text 2": "When you engage in high-intensity training, eat at night, have elevated body temperature, or even have thoughts and emotions such as stress or excitement, your heart rate will increase.",
  "Heart Rate Text 3": "When you are in a relaxed state, such as before and during sleep, your heart rate will decrease.",
  "Exercise heart rate interval": "Exercise heart rate interval",
  "Exercise heart rate interval Text 1": "Rest Heart Rate (RHR) and Max Heart Rate (MHR) are the two most important parameters that determine an individual's training interval. Resting heart rate refers to the rate of heartbeat in a quiet state. In a quiet state, the normal heart rate for adults is 60-100 beats per minute, and the ideal heart rate should be 55-70 beats per minute (the heart rate of athletes is generally about 50 beats per minute slower than that of ordinary adults). The most commonly used calculation method for maximum heart rate is to subtract your age from 220 to obtain your maximum heart rate. For example, a 32 year old person's maximum heart rate is 188 beats per minute, which means MHR=220 years old. Understanding the impact of average heart rate during running on human health can help you achieve more ideal and efficient exercise results.",
